## How to use
Since this kit is designed for starting developers that want to get a little more fancy with their development kit, I will explain this with terminal and Visual Studio Code support.

### Terminal
1. Clone this project and rename it as necessary.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install` (npm: Install Dependencies in VS Code). This will do a first time set-up with any existing css or js files. Useful for when you continue after a long time.
3. Start the gulp watch task with `npm start` or `gulp watch` (Tasks: Run Task in VS Code).
4. Have a nice time developing!
5. If you're completely done and ready to launch (please always create a back-up) run `npm run build` to create a production ready version without all source files.

**NB: Never push the build version to github, that's only for when you want to place the project on a server.**


### Visual Studio Code
1. Clone this project and rename it as necessary.
2. Open this folder in VSCode.
2. Install the dependencies with the `npm: Install Dependencies` command. This will do a first time set-up with any existing css or js files. Useful for when you continue after a long time.
3. Start the gulp watch task with either `npm start` or `gulp watch` with the `Tasks: Run Task` command.
4. Have a nice time developing!
5. If you're completely done and ready to launch (please always create a back-up) run the `build` task from either NPM or Gulp with the `Tasks: Run Task` command. This creates a production ready version without all source files.

**NB: Never push the build version to github, that's only for when you want to place the project on a server.**
